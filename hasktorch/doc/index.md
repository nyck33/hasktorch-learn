Welcome to Hasktorch!

Hasktorch is a Haskell library for scientific computing and
differentiable programming. It leverages [libtorch][] (the backend
library powering PyTorch) for efficient tensor manipulation and
automatic differentiation, while bringing to bear Haskell's powerful
type system and first-class support for pure [functional
programming][olah-nn-types-fp].
