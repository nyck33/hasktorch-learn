# Getting Started

## Installation

Installation guides for supported platforms can be found in the [readme][readme-getting-started].

[readme-getting-started]: https://github.com/hasktorch/hasktorch#getting-started

## Editor integration

Hasktorch strives to present an ergonomic, strongly-typed interface
for developing numerical algorithms. Certain interactive IDE features
(e.g. displaying the type of an identifier when you hover over it) are
very useful for this style of development. To this end, we recommend
installing [haskell-language-server][hls] and an integration for your
preferred editor.
